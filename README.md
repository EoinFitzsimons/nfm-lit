## Need For Madness: LIT

Need For Madness: LIT (NFML) is a decompilation and subsequent improvement of Need For Madness 2, developed by Radicalplay.com.

It is designed to provide a smooth gameplay experience for the vanilla game (with tweaks - see below) as well as a solid foundation for modifying and building upon for prospective hackers.
In order to achieve this, much of the original source code needs rewriting. While some work has been done, much more needs doing, so please feel free to contribute!

Some of the work already done includes:

- Providing a complete, playable, version of NFM2.
- Improving 2D graphics rendering to not rely on a hardcoded screen resolution (however, dynamic scaling is not yet supported).
- Improving the fluency and look & feel of the overall game.
- Rendering at 720p by default.
- Providing a much more reasonable source tree, grouping the source files into subfolders where appropriate.

However, much more work needs doing. There are still hardcoded values all over the code relating to rendering, AI, stages, cars, and more.
Ideally, all of these subsystems should be decoupled from each other in order to facilitate a much smoother hacking experience.

Special thanks to:

- cravxx (Kaffienated) for the initial decompilation and tidy-up of NFM2.
- G6 for providing some helpful hacks to improve stage select visuals.
- stants12 (m0squ1t0/oteek) for further building upon and improving the original decompilation.
- FlameCharge (Jacherr) for fixing UI to work properly at 720p resolutions.
- Everyone else who offered improvements, fixes, and anything else!

## EoinChanges

**Major Refactoring and Modernization (August 2025)**

This section documents the extensive refactoring and modernization work completed to transform the codebase from a broken state with 1253+ compilation errors into a fully functional, modern Java application.(The errors were caused from initial refactoring and compiling with maven.)

### üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Improvements**

**Configuration Classes Created:**

- `RenderConfig` - Centralized rendering parameters and constants
- `AIConfig` - AI behavior parameters and tuning values
- `CarConfig` - Vehicle physics and characteristics
- `StageConfig` - Level configuration and track parameters
- `InputConfig` - Input handling and control mappings
- `SoundConfig` - Audio system configuration

These classes replace hundreds of hardcoded magic numbers scattered throughout the codebase, providing centralized configuration management and improved maintainability.

### üîß **Build System Modernization**

**Maven Integration:**

- Configured proper dependency management for existing JAR libraries
- Set up automated resource copying from `data/` to `target/classes/data`

[INFO] Developer Console triggered
```

**Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ‚úÖ

### üèõÔ∏è **Interface Design and Decoupling (August 11, 2025)**

**IGameEngine Interface Implementation:**

- Created `IGameEngine` interface defining core game engine contract with 15 methods
- Implemented complete interface in `GameSparker` class for better architectural decoupling
- Added `GameEngineFactory` for dependency injection and future extensibility

**Core System Components:**

- **`RaceSettingsManager`** - Singleton manager handling race configuration and validation
- **`RaceSettingsUI`** - In-game overlay UI for configuring races during car/stage selection  
- **`TrackMetadataLoader`** - Loads actual track data from stage files for authentic configuration
- **`CarPoolManager`** - Manages car assignments and prevents track piece assignment bugs
- **Multiple RaceSettings classes** - Immutable value objects for race configuration state

**Key Features Implemented:**

- ‚úÖ **Real Car Integration**: Uses actual NFM car models from `CarConfig.CAR_MODELS` (16 cars)
- ‚úÖ **Authentic Unlock Progression**: Implements correct NFM car unlock system
- ‚úÖ **Track Metadata Integration**: Loads real track data with lap counts and checkpoints
- ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: Race settings overlay integrated into `XtGraphics.carselect()`
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Validation**: Settings validated against track metadata and engine limits
- ‚úÖ **AI Car Assignment**: Proper AI car selection from available car pool (no track pieces)

**NFM-Authentic Car Unlock Progression:**

The system implements the correct Need For Madness car unlock progression:

- **Game Start**: 8 cars available (2000tornados through koolkat, indices 0-7)
- **Boss Car Unlocks** (unlocked after completing their second track):
  - After Track 2: +drifter (index 8)
  - After Track 4: +policecops (index 9)  
  - After Track 6: +mustang (index 10)
  - After Track 8: +king (index 11)
  - After Track 10: +audir8 (index 12)
  - After Track 12: +masheen (index 13)
  - After Track 14: +radicalone (index 14)
  - After Track 16: +drmonster (index 15) - Final unlock
- **Track 17**: Playground with all 16 cars available

**Test Suite and Verification:**

A comprehensive test suite validates the race settings system functionality:

- **Game State Integration**: Updates `GameFacts.numberOfPlayers` and `sc[]` array
- **Track Integration**: Uses `CheckPoints` data for lap configuration
- **AI Assignment**: Properly configures AI car selection in `GameSparker`

**Bug Fixes Resolved:**

1. **Track Piece Assignment Bug**: Fixed issue where increasing AI count assigned track pieces as cars
2. **Car Array Management**: Corrected `aconto1[]` array population to contain only car models
3. **Unlock Progression**: Implemented correct NFM progression instead of generic formula
4. **Real Car Integration**: Replaced mock car data with actual `CarConfig.CAR_MODELS`

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Design Pattern**: Singleton manager with immutable configuration objects
- **Validation System**: Real-time validation with detailed error reporting
- **State Management**: Clean separation between UI state and game configuration
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-ready architecture for custom race modes
- **Performance**: Efficient car assignment algorithms with proper array management

**Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ‚úÖ

The race settings system provides a rich, NFM-authentic race configuration experience while maintaining full compatibility with the existing game engine. All tests pass and the system integrates seamlessly with the game's car selection and stage selection interfaces.
